# RentIt

This is a unfinished project !!

Idea is to develop micro service for Renting agricultural equipments and as well as its operator(Man power).

Trying to build Micro services architecture with Dot.net and Node js. The Catalog service(Node.js) in this repo will make call to Basket Service whenever there is product price update via Kafka. Before running this please have the catalogService running because some of the docker container would be needed from that repo untill i add docker compose for this repo.
